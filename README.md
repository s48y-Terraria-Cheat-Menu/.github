# 🎮 Terraria Cheat Menu – Total Game Control in One Click

## 💡 What Is the Terraria Cheat Menu?

The **Terraria Cheat Menu** is an in-game UI overlay that gives players **access to dozens of cheat features** in real time. Usually integrated via mods like **Cheat Sheet**, **Hero's Mod**, or **TModLoader custom menus**, it replaces the need for console commands or item IDs.

Everything is handled through click-based toggles, sliders, lists, and instant buttons 🔘💥
